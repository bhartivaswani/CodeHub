## Discription
A CodePen clone made with React and Material UI is a web application that provides a similar functionality and user interface as the popular code playground platform CodePen. Users can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate code editors and see the live output in real-time.

## Key Components & Features
Code Editors: The application provides separate code editors for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to write and edit code in each respective language.

Preview Pane: As users type their code in the editors, the application updates a preview pane in real-time, displaying the rendered output based on the entered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Theme Customization: Material UI provides a wide range of pre-built UI components and themes. Users can customize the visual appearance of their code editor and the overall application using Material UI's theming capabilities.

CodeMirror: It is a popular choice for implementing the code editing functionality. CodeMirror is a versatile and customizable JavaScript library that provides a rich and interactive code editing experience.
